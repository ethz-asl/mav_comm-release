ros-jade-mav-msgs (3.0.0-0vivid) vivid; urgency=high

  * Dropped "Command" from the names of all messages.
  * Converted CommandPositionYawTrajectory message to MultiDOFJointTrajectory (with an additional option to use a geometry_msgs/PoseStamped instead) as the two ways to send trajectory/waypoint commands.
  * Added conversions between the Eigen and ROS message types.
  * Switched to using full orientation instead of just yaw where appropriate.
  * Documented reference frame in the Eigen messages where possible.
